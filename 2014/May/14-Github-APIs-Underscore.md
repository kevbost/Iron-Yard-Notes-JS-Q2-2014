##GITHUBSOMETHING

* Rebuild github profile.
* Loop over the array of repo objects, fetching the real data.
* github api
* <a href="api.github.com/users/kevbost">api.github.com/users/kevbost</a>

##JSON API's
Javascript Object Notation

* Everything is a "string" because javascript has reserved words
	* so {"function" : "foobar"} is valid because the word function is in a string.
* A Restful API will make heavy use of URLS.
* Uses a very consistent URL syntax.
